- 👋 Nemo Czanderlitch (alt. Nino Čandrlić, Нино Чандрлић)

- 👀 I’m interested in *\*inhale\**: 
  - **Physics** (specifically fields pertaining to Robotics)
  - **Maths** (...this interest is varied but has a trend of surging one day before the test)
  - **Graphics** (Rendering, shaders, animation, etc.)
  - **Teaching** (any being within a 5m radius of me coding **is** classified a programmers ducky... not a threat; **a guarantee**.)
  - **Writing Documentation** (if I have to pick my poison, might a well make it LSD)
  - **Challenges** (the more impossible it is, so greater is the weight of achievement)
  - And in general, making things which make you say: "How/Why the hell did you make that?"

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be the best project lead Enactus has ever seen... but am also studying CS at DCU
